## Licensing

Pkl Rust is released under the Apache 2.0 license. Just like the [pkl-go](https://github.com/apple/pkl-go) and the [pkl](https://pkl-lang.org) project.
This is why we require that, by submitting a pull request, you acknowledge that you have the right to license your contribution to Apple and the community, and agree that your contribution is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Issue Tracking

To file a bug or feature request, use [GitHub](https://github.com/Sir-NoChill/pkl-rust/issues).
Be sure to include the following information:

- Context
    - What are/were you trying to achieve?
    - What's the impact of this bug/feature?

## Pull Requests

When preparing a pull request, follow this checklist:

- Imitate the conventions of surrounding code.
- Format `.pkl` files in your PR sensibly (consider the JetBrains IDE formatter, but I will not enforce that for this repository).
- Follow the [seven rules](https://gist.github.com/julienbourdeau/e605e4b8b47da97c249a0f72598529c8) of great Git commit messages:
  - Separate subject from body with a blank line.
  - Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
  - Capitalize the subject line.
  - Do not end the subject line with a period.
  - Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
  - Wrap the body at 72 characters.
  - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.
