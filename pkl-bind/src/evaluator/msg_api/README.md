# Message Passing system for PKL

These files contain the default behaviours for message passing in the pkl bindings. This specification is detailed on [the website](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/bindings-specification/index.html#https://github.com/apple/pkl-go) and these files are modeled after the [go implementation](https://github.com/apple/pkl-go/tree/main).

Note that for serialization we use the methods given by [rmp_serde](https://docs.rs/rmp-serde/latest/rmp_serde/).
